## JS Anonymous Function

### Instructions

The function above is actually an anonymous function (a function without a name).

Functions stored in variables do not need function names. They are always invoked (called) using the variable name.

## Task:

+ Anonymous functions are used a lot as callback functions. Below you are given a higher order function named hof.

+ That takes two arguments: Its first parameter is a string and the second parameter is a callback function.

+ Pass a string named devsnest as the first argument and an anonymous callback function that returns a string as the second argument.

## Example:

```
const x = function (a, b) {return a * b};
```
