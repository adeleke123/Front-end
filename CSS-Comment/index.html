/*

This is an HTML file that appears to be setting up a page for running Mocha tests.

The first line, <!DOCTYPE html>, is the HTML5 document type declaration, which tells the web browser that this is an HTML document and what version of HTML it is written in.

The <html> element is the root element of the HTML document, and the lang attribute specifies the language of the document.

The <head> element contains information about the document, such as the title and character encoding. The <title> element specifies the title of the document, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab. The <meta> element with a charset attribute specifies the character encoding for the document, which is set to utf-8 in this case. The <meta> element with a name attribute set to viewport and a content attribute specifying the width and initial-scale is used to set the viewport for the page, which determines how the page is displayed on different devices.

The <body> element contains the main content of the document. Inside the body, there is a <div> element with a heading and a paragraph. There is also another <div> element with an id attribute set to clean-board and a nested <div> element with an id attribute set to black-spot.

There are also two <script> elements included in the <body>. The type attribute of each element is set to module, which indicates that the script is a JavaScript module that is run in strict mode. The src attribute specifies the source of the script, which appears to be two separate files: setup.js and run.js.

Finally, there is a <div> element with an id attribute set to mocha, which is included in the <body> but does not appear to have any content. It is possible that this element is used to display the results of the Mocha tests.
